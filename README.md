# Image Reveal Animations
A small and simple JavaScript library which uses GSAP to create some image reveal animations that trigger on HTML element hover.


## Demo
Check out the demo of this project right [here](https://vanjazeli.github.io/image-reveal-animations/). 


## Usage
Make sure to install GSAP library into your current project.
Import the Ira class from ira.js file into the file where you would like to initialize an animation.
Initialize an animation by passing in the element, imageUrl and animationType into the Ira class with `new Ira(element, imageUrl, animationType)`.

```JavaScript
import Ira from "./ira.js";

const element = document.querySelector(".my-element");
const imageUrl = "./images/my-image.png";
const animationType = "slide"

new Ira(element, imageUrl, animationType);
```

The `Ira(element, imageUrl, animationType)` class takes in three arguements: element, imageUrl and animationType.

| Arguement | Type | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:------------|
| `element` | object | Defines an object from the dom to which we would like to add the desired hover animation. |
| `imageUrl` | string | Defines a path to the image that we would like to display when the desired element gets hovered. |
| `animationType` | string | Defines the name of the animation that we would like to use. |

Currently available animation names are: `"boring"`, `"fade"`, `"unfold"`, `"slide"`, `"corner"` and `"spiral"`.
